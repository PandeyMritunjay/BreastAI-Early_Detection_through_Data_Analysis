# BreastAI-Early_Detection_through_Data_Analysis
Construct predictive models to predict using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor.  

Objectives:
* Identifying the problem and Data Sources.
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Pre-Processing the Data for model building.
* Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant(1) or Benign(0).

What I had done:
* Made a predictive model using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. The diagnosis of a breast tumor is a binary variable (benign or malignant).
* Evaluating the model using confusion matrix.
* Tune the parameters of the SVM Classification model using scikit-learn.
